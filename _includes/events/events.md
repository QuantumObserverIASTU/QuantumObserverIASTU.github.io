## Group Meeting

*Updated on 8th October 2023*

**Title**: ​Entanglement detection and entanglement measures (I)<br>
**Speaker**: Yang-Yang Tang (汤炀阳)​<br>
**Time**: 13:30, Oct 15, 2023 (Sunday)<br>
**Venue**: Conference Hall 322, Science Building (科学馆), Tsinghua University<br>
**Abstract**: Entanglement is considered to be the most nonclassical manifestation of quantum formalism. Entanglement detection are some criteria that aims to determining weather a state is entangled, and entanglement measures are functions that attempts to quantify the entanglement of the state. In this talk I will introduce some basic knowledge on entanglement detection and entanglement measures, Some widely used detection criteria and measures, such as PPT criterion and the corresponding negativity, will also be discussed. I will also discuss some recent ideas and results about the calculation of negativity in free quantum field theories.

## Group Meeting

*Updated on 2nd June 2023*

**Title**: Accuracy threshold for topological quantum memory<br>
**Speaker**: Wang Yi-Fei (王逸飞)<br>
**Time**: 3:00 pm, Thursday, June 8, 2023<br>
**Venue**: Backyard (Conference Hall 322 if rainy), Science Building, Tsinghua University<br>
**Abstract**: I will review an estimation of the accuracy threshold for a surface code to be a reliable topological quantum memory (arXiv:quant-ph/0110143) and some recent progress (arXiv:2301.05689). This talk will be self-contained so no background for coding theory is required. I will focus on the interplay of computational tasks and physical considerations, while some techniques for implementing quantum computation will not be covered in detail.
